## Secondary phenotypes modeling

Code implementing a few models for analysis of so-called _secondary phenotypes_; see [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684820/) for some details.

File `R/sourcing.R` has example code to load functions, generate data, and fit two models (one parametric and one semi-parametric) from an R console.
